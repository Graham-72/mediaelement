# Media Element

Media Element provides HTML5 video and audio elements for HTML4 browsers
by using mediaelement.js . This is a jQuery based JavaScript plugin that
enables the video and audio tags using h.264 to work under browsers
that do not support the tag or the codec and provides a consistent
interface across all browsers.

This is a port from the Drupal module of the same name, version 7.x-1.2

## Status

This is an initial port ready for testing.


## Installation

- Download MediaElement from http://mediaelementjs.com/

- Unzip into a libraries directory supported by the libraries module
  with the name mediaelement (e.g., libraries/mediaelement).

- Install the libraries and mediaelement modules using the official
  Backdrop CMS instructions at https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules

- Use the configuration page at /admin/config/media/mediaelement to
  check that the library is working and optionally to
  enable mediaelement.js site wide.

the work done by the developers and maintainers of the Drupal module.
